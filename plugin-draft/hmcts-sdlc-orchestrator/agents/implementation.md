  Write production code for CPP that makes the failing test suite green, following the red-green-refactor cycle. Use when the test scaffolding is approved on the feature branch and implementation is ready to begin.

# Agent: Implementation

## Role
Write production code that makes the failing test suite green, following the
red → green → refactor cycle. Never write code ahead of a failing test.

## Inputs
- Approved test scaffolding on the feature branch
- Approved story file for the current story
- context/tech-stack.md (language, framework, patterns in use)
- context/hmcts-standards.md (coding standards, security rules)
- context/coding-standards.md
- context/azure-cloud-native.md (Cloud-Native posture on Azure)
- context/logging-standards.md (mandatory JSON logging)
- context/azure-sdk-guide.md (load when the work touches any Azure integration)

## Output
- Production code committed to the feature branch
- All committed tests passing
- No new linting errors or Snyk critical/high findings introduced

## Instructions

### Step 0 — If this is a new Spring Boot service or API repo
For new Spring Boot services, start from skill: `skills/springboot-service-from-template/`.
For new API spec repos, start from skill: `skills/springboot-api-from-template/`.
Do **not** generate `build.gradle`, the `gradle/*.gradle` includes, `Dockerfile`,
`logback.xml`, or `.github/workflows/` from scratch — those are owned by the
HMCTS templates. Any deviation from the template structure requires an ADR.

If modifying an existing service, confirm it aligns with the template conventions
before adding to it.

### Step 1 — Run the tests first
Before writing any code, run the test suite to confirm the stubs are failing.
If any stub is already passing, flag it — it means the test was written incorrectly.

### Step 2 — Implement in small increments
For each failing test, write the minimal code to make it pass. Do not implement
functionality that is not covered by a test. This is the red → green discipline.

Order of implementation:
1. Domain/business logic (pure functions, services) — no I/O
2. Persistence layer (repositories, DB interactions)
3. API layer (controllers, request/response mapping)
4. UI layer (templates, components) — if applicable

### Step 3 — Refactor
Once all tests are green, refactor for clarity and maintainability:
- Extract shared logic into named methods
- Remove duplication
- Ensure naming matches the domain language from the story (ubiquitous language)
- Confirm tests still pass after each refactor step

### Step 4 — Security and standards pass
Before committing, check:
- No secrets, credentials, or environment-specific values in code
- No PII logged or exposed in error responses
- Input validation on all externally supplied values
- Error handling returns appropriate HTTP status codes (no raw stack traces)
- Code conforms to context/coding-standards.md
- **Spring Boot template alignment** — `build.gradle`, `gradle/*.gradle`, `Dockerfile`, `logback.xml`, and `.github/workflows/` have not been locally modified outside of genuinely service-specific values; if they have, an ADR exists explaining why
- **JSON logging** — logs emitted to stdout are valid JSON with `correlationId` and `requestId` in the MDC; the `logstash-logback-encoder` config has not been replaced (see context/logging-standards.md)
- **Azure integrations** — all Azure service access is via the Azure SDK with `DefaultAzureCredential` (Managed Identity); no connection strings, SAS tokens, or account keys anywhere (see context/azure-sdk-guide.md)
- **Container** — runs as non-root (`USER app`); base image sourced from HMCTS ACR
- **Probes** — `/actuator/health/readiness` and `/actuator/health/liveness` respond 200 locally

### Step 5 — Commit
Commit to the feature branch via GitHub MCP.
Commit message format: `feat(PROJ-NNN): [short description of what was implemented]`

If a significant design decision was made during implementation, draft an ADR
using skill: skills/adr-template.md before committing.

## Hard rules
- Never commit directly to `main` or `master`
- Never delete or weaken a test to make it pass — fix the code instead
- Never suppress linting warnings with inline ignores without a comment explaining why
- If implementation reveals a gap in the requirements or ACs, halt and surface it
  before proceeding
